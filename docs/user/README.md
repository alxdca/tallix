- **Budget year**: Tallix organizes budgets by year. You can switch between current and archived years.
- **Groups and items**: Categories are grouped into income and expense sections.
- **Payment methods**: Card or bank accounts used to pay. They can be linked to accounts and savings.
- **Transactions**: Each transaction belongs to a budget year and optionally a category item.
- **Assets and debts**: A separate multi-year view tracks non-transaction assets and liabilities.
