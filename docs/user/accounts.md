# Accounts and Payment Methods

Payment methods represent how you pay (cards, bank accounts, etc). They also power account balances and projections.

## Add payment methods

- Go to Settings > Accounts.
- Add each card or account you use.
- Set an institution if you want to group by bank in the UI.

## Savings accounts

You can mark a payment method as a savings account:

- Toggle the savings flag.
- Choose a savings type (for example: epargne, prevoyance, investissements).

Savings accounts are excluded from some projections that focus on spending accounts.

## Settlement day

For credit cards, set a settlement day to move charges into the correct accounting month. This helps align transactions with statements.

## Linked accounts

If a card is funded by a specific bank account, link it so balances roll up correctly in projections and assets.

## Reordering

Drag and drop payment methods to control display order.
