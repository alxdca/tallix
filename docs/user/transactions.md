# Transactions

This section covers manual entry, bulk actions, and duplicate warnings.

## Add a transaction

1. Click the add button in the Transactions view.
2. Provide date, amount, payment method, and optional category and third party.
3. Save to add it to the current year.

## Edit or delete

- Click a row to edit the transaction details.
- Use the delete action for single rows or use bulk selection for multiple rows.

## Accounting month and year

Tallix tracks both the transaction date and the accounting period. This helps when card statements are billed in a later month.

- If you set a settlement day on a payment method, the accounting month and year can be calculated automatically.
- You can also override the accounting period manually.

## Duplicate warnings

When adding a transaction, Tallix checks for potential duplicates:

- Same third party
- Amount within +/- 5 percent
- Date within +/- 1 day

Potential duplicates are highlighted with a warning background. You can dismiss the warning if the transaction is valid.

## Transfers

Transfers represent money moved between accounts and do not affect budget categories. Keep them separate from standard transactions to avoid inflating expenses or income.

## Tips

- Use third party names consistently for better search and duplicate detection.
- Use bulk delete to clean up imported data quickly.
