# Assets, Debts, and Net Worth

The Assets view is a multi-year ledger for assets and liabilities that are not tracked as transactions.

## Sections

- **Assets**: Houses, investments, cash holdings, or other assets.
- **Debts**: Loans, credit balances, or any liabilities.
- **Net worth**: Sum of assets minus sum of debts.

## System categories and accounts

Tallix creates system rows for account-linked balances so you can see assets derived from payment methods and savings accounts. These rows are read only for the current year and computed from account balances.

A note in the footer explains that current-year system balances are derived from current account balances.

## Add assets or debts

- Use the plus button near the Assets or Debt header to add a new row.
- Choose a name and enter values per year.
- Rows added in Assets are treated as assets, rows added in Debt are treated as liabilities.

## Editing past years

You can edit values for past years, including system rows, to correct historical data.

## Totals

- Assets table shows a total labeled "Total des biens".
- Debts table shows a total debt row even when empty.
- Net worth table shows the overall net worth per year.

## Tips

- Keep assets and debts up to date at year boundaries to maintain accurate net worth.
- Use consistent naming to make trends easier to track.
