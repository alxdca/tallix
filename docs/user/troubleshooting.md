# Troubleshooting

Common issues and quick fixes.

## Transactions not showing

- Make sure you are viewing the correct year.
- Use the Archive section to check past years.

## Duplicate warning appears but it is not a duplicate

- Use the dismiss warning action to clear it.
- Review the third party field for consistency.

## Budgets look wrong after imports

- Check that transactions are mapped to the correct year and payment method.
- Verify accounting month/year for credit card transactions.

## Assets or debts look incorrect

- For the current year, system rows are computed from account balances.
- For past years, edit the values directly.

## Unable to delete or update

- If you are logged out, log in again.
- If the issue persists, refresh and retry.

If none of the above helps, capture the exact error message and share it with support.
