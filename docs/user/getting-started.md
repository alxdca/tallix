# Getting Started

This guide walks through the first time setup for a new budget.

## 1. Create an account and log in

- Use the signup/login screen to create your account.
- The app stores your language and country preferences for formatting and AI imports.

## 2. Configure your start year

Tallix uses a start year to generate the list of budget years.

- Go to Settings > Preferences.
- Set the start year to the first year you want to track.
- The app generates missing years between the start year and the current year.

## 3. Set up categories

- Go to Settings > Categories.
- Create income and expense groups (for example: Income, Housing, Food).
- Add items inside each group (for example: Salary, Rent, Groceries).
- Drag and drop to reorder groups and items.

## 4. Add payment methods

- Go to Settings > Accounts.
- Add a payment method for each card or bank account you use.
- Optionally set an institution name.
- Mark a method as savings and set the savings type when relevant.
- Set a settlement day if the card has a billing cycle.
- Link a payment method to another one if it is funded by a specific account.

## 5. Add transactions

- Go to Transactions.
- Add transactions manually or import them.
- Assign a category, payment method, and optional third party.

## 6. Review your budget

- Budget Planning: set monthly and yearly budgets per item.
- Funds Summary: understand starting balances and projected remaining funds.

## 7. Track assets and debts (optional)

- Use the Assets view to track assets and debts that are not in transactions.
- Add separate rows for assets and debts and keep them updated by year.

Next: read the sections that match your workflow in the user documentation index.
