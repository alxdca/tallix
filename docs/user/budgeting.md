# Budgeting and Planning

Tallix uses yearly budgets with monthly and yearly allocations for each item.

## Budget structure

- **Groups**: High-level buckets (income, expense).
- **Items**: Specific categories inside a group (rent, groceries).
- **Monthly budget**: Recurring planned amount.
- **Yearly budget**: Optional annual planned amount for variable spending.

## Budget planning view

Use the planning view to set:

- Monthly budgets for recurring costs.
- Yearly budgets for irregular spending.
- A clear view of remaining budget (with color cues).

## Funds summary

The funds summary shows:

- Projected funds at the start and end of each month.
- Actual funds based on account balances.
- A combination of monthly and yearly budgets for projections.

## Reordering and organization

- Drag and drop groups and items to reorder.
- Move items between groups when your structure changes.

## Savings and special items

Some items are marked as savings in the data model. These can be used to separate savings from everyday expenses and keep planning clean.

## Tips

- Start with a small, simple set of categories and grow over time.
- Use yearly budgets for items like travel, gifts, or large one-off purchases.
